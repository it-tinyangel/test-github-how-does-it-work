## GitHub testing :rocket:

#### How does ***[GitHub](https://github.com/)*** work

> Basic recommendation for learning how work it do, experiment and discover. You'll soon learn to get what you want. :muscle: :sunglasses: :sunglasses:

***<strong>Default</strong>*** **brunch names**:

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

Strikethrough out text. ~~Scratch worlds.~~

***

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

Also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
